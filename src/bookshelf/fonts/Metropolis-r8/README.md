# The Metropolis Typeface

The Vision
---
To create a modern, geometric typeface. Open sourced, and openly available. Influenced by other popular geometric, minimalist sans-serif typefaces of the new millenium. Designed for optimal readability at small point sizes while beautiful at large point sizes.

Roadmap
---
Currently (as of August 2016) working on italicized versions of the 3 master weights for a total of 18 styles (9 regular, 9 italic). After that, I plan on creating a 'Rounded' style, followed ultimately by a 'Slab' style. This ideally would mean there would be a total of 54 styles.
